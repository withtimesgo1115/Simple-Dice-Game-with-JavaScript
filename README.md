# Simple-Dice-Game-with-JavaScript
This is a simple dice game implemented by JavaScript and DOM. Honestly, I am aimed at practicing manipulating DOM by means of JS.
The game requires two players to join and the basic rules are shown below:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
